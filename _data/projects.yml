    RTSA Primarily is a Display System Application to tune the Radios on the Aircraft. It uses AFDX communication network  and interacts with LRUâ€™s that use ARINC429 protocol.

    RTSA  is a display  system application  with UDP input/output Connections. It communicates to the Graphics server using AFDX network and also receives ARINC661 Events and Notifications from AGS regarding the Tuning information .It transmits ARINC 661 Run time Modifiable Parameters(RMP) to AGS(ARINC Graphics server) and Update the User Interface.It  also transmits tuning information related to communication , Navigation and Surveillance Radios as ARINC664 data via AFDX network connection.It also interacts with Input/Output concentrator (IOCs) so that it can transmit and receive information to and from real radios and primary tuners that use ARINC 429 protocol.
    
    The Radios that are controlled by RTSA includes:
    ADF, NAV, HF, VHF, ATC, SELCAL.

    Environment : C, MATLAB, Eclipse, Subversion, Vector Cast, DOORS, Understanding C, Visual C++ Express Edition, VAPS XT.

    Tools : Python,Perl, Vista (Test Environment), Eclipse, Subversion, MATLAB Simulink
